# Deep-learning-project-milestone

This repository contains the code for the Digital Sudoku SatNet project and it primarily refers to the ICML 2019 SatNet paper [https://icml.cc/Conferences/2019/Schedule?showEvent=3947]
We played with the number of parameters and get the model output printed.

** **Background: What is SATNet?

SATNet is a differentiable (smoothed) maximum satisfiability (MAXSAT) solver that can be integrated into the loop of larger deep learning systems. Our (approximate) solver is based upon a fast coordinate descent approach to solving the semidefinite program (SDP) associated with the MAXSAT problem.


** **What do these experiments do? 

These experiments show that, by integrating the SATNet solver into end-to-end learning systems, we can learn the logical structure of challenging problems in a minimally supervised fashion. 
In particular, this file will show you some sample output of the SatNet-based mode to play 9Ã—9 Sudoku (original and permuted) solely from examples.

** **The Sudoku Dataset

The 10K 9x9 Sudoku boards (9K test/1K train) used in this project was from [https://github.com/Kyubyong/sudoku]


** **Experiment procedure

First, the game started with an unsolved Sudoku, with several initially filled digits.

After the initially unsolved Sudoku went through the SatNet-based model, we printed out the output to visualize the performance of the model. 

For illustration, we painted the model generated digits in green and red. 

If the digits are correctly generated, we painted it green. 
If the digits are wrong, we painted it red. 

We checked the result up until 20 epochs for the first sample in our test set, and found that starting from 4 until 20 epochs, the model does a perfect job in generating the right answer. 

For convenience, we decided to attach only the first 4 epochs results for the first sample in our test set as a demonstration.
